# Git Probe

Git Probe is a tool that monitors changes to specified files and directories in GitHub repositories. It runs daily using GitHub Actions, extracting change information and maintaining a history of these changes.

## Features

- Monitor specific files and directories in GitHub repositories
- Automatically check for updates daily via GitHub Actions
- Display detailed daily changes including commits, file content changes, and AI summaries
- Store historical changes in the `history/` directory with date-based naming
- Maintain repository-specific AI summaries in the `summaries/` directory
- Configurable monitoring via `probe.yaml`
- Project settings in `config.yaml` or environment variables
- Fast dependency management with UV

## How It Works

1. Each day, Git Probe checks the repositories specified in `probe.yaml`
2. For each repository, it retrieves:
   - Recent commits
   - Actual file content changes (diffs)
   - AI-generated summary of these changes (if enabled)
3. This information is displayed in the README.md under "Latest Changes"
4. Previous day's changes are archived to the `history/` directory with the format `repo_name_date.md`
5. Repository-specific summaries are maintained in the `summaries/` directory
