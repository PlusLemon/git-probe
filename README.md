# Git Probe

Git Probe is a tool that monitors changes to specified files and directories in GitHub repositories. It runs daily using GitHub Actions, extracting change information and maintaining a history of these changes.

## Features

- Monitor specific files and directories in GitHub repositories
- Automatically check for updates daily via GitHub Actions
- Display detailed daily changes including commits, file content changes, and AI summaries
- Store historical changes in the `history/` directory with date-based naming
- Maintain repository-specific AI summaries in the `summaries/` directory
- Configurable monitoring via `probe.yaml`
- Project settings in `config.yaml` or environment variables
- Fast dependency management with UV

## How It Works

1. Each day, Git Probe checks the repositories specified in `probe.yaml`
2. For each repository, it retrieves:
   - Recent commits
   - Actual file content changes (diffs)
   - AI-generated summary of these changes (if enabled)
3. This information is displayed in the README.md under "Latest Changes"
4. Previous day's changes are archived to the `history/` directory with the format `repo_name_date.md`
5. Repository-specific summaries are maintained in the `summaries/` directory

##### AI Summary

The GitHub repository `awesome-mcp-servers` added a new ROS MCP Server entry to its README (2dc5837), featuring a Python-based tool ([lpigeon/ros-mcp-server](https://github.com/lpigeon/ros-mcp-server)) that converts natural language commands into ROS/ROS2 control commands for robotics. This +1 line change expands the repository's catalog of MCP servers with a specialized solution for robot control systems. While no code was modified, the update enhances the resource list for developers working on language-to-robot command interfaces. The addition strengthens the repository's coverage of MCP server implementations across different domains.
